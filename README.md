Remember the Coding Horror article about how many people can't pass the "Fizz Buzz" test?

I was deeply embarassed to say I was one of them, despite years of Unix mastery I had never actually sat down and tried.

Until today. Then I was shocked at how easy it was, and now the true Horror of why it's so scary that people can't do this hits home.

And so I give you, the Fizz Buzz test:

Take every number from 1 to 100. If it's divisable by 3, write fizz, if divisible by 5, write buzz. If divisible by both, write fizz buzz.

Here's the secret: If you write fizz OR buzz you'll already write fizz buzz if both are true. So many people seem to break their brains on that.

Strange.

TIL: Programming is about thinking differently. Don't approach a problem with your normal mind-set. 

Also:  Cheat. Seriously. Read this code. Understand it. There, now you can pass the test. You also learned something. Bonus!
